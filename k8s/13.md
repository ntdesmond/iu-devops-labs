## Changes to Helm

- Deployment is replaced with StatefulSet
- `replicaCount` changed from 1 to 2
- `helm install --dry-run --debug` reported no errors
- nothing was moved to `values.yaml` since there is nothing to move
- no **PersistentVolumeClaims** added since `redis` is used for persistency.

`kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc` output:

## Testing the service

After running `minikube service py-app-python-app`, the service was accessed several times. However, the number of visits reported at `/status` did not change between two replicas â€” this is because they both use a single `redis` instance.

To see that both pods are actually in use, I configured `gunicorn` to print access log entries to stdout. This way we will be able to see these through `kubectl logs` command.

Using some bash tricks we can find the number of requests served by each pod:

```sh
for i in 0 1
do
  POD="pod/py-app-python-app-$i"
  echo -n "$POD: "
  kubectl logs "$POD" | grep "GET / HTTP" | wc -l
done
```

Output:

```text
pod/py-app-python-app-0: 42
pod/py-app-python-app-1: 33
```

As we see, services are not distributing the requests equally. Plus, StatefulSet launched the pods sequentially, so the first pod was able to handle requests earlier than the second one.

## Launch in parallel

Since the pods don't depend on each other, we can actually configure StatefulSet to launch the pods in parallel by adding `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` to the spec. I decided to add it to `values.yaml` and reference in the StatefulSet template:

```diff
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: {{ include "python-app.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "python-app.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
+ podManagementPolicy: {{ .Values.podManagementPolicy }}
...
```

This way, if we run `kubectl get po` right after installing the chart, we can see that both pods are started simultaneously:

```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/py-app-python-app-0             0/1     Running   0          4s
pod/py-app-python-app-1             0/1     Running   0          4s
pod/py-app-redis-7568c9bf5c-4t5mn   1/1     Running   0          4s
```

## Second app chart updates

I changed the second app chart in the same way as the first one, including the parallel pod management.

`kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc` output:

```text
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/ts-app-0                        1/1     Running   0          25s
pod/ts-app-1                        1/1     Running   0          25s
pod/ts-app-redis-7fd8776cbc-rlddh   1/1     Running   0          25s

NAME                      READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/ts-app   2/2     25s

NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP    28d
service/ts-app         ClusterIP   10.100.18.183    <none>        3000/TCP   25s
service/ts-app-redis   ClusterIP   10.107.228.217   <none>        6379/TCP   25s
```

Request count:

Request count per pod (same bash thing but `POD="pod/ts-app-$i"`):

```text
pod/ts-app-0: 53
pod/ts-app-1: 47
```

## Update strategies

- `onDelete` makes `StatefulSet` apply updates only on newly created pods.Existing pods should be deleted manually to allow `StatefulSet` recreate them with updated configuration.

- Default `RollingUpdate` strategy recreates pods automatically, without the need to delete pods manually.
