## ConfigMap and volumes

[`files/config.json`](./helm/python-app/files/config.json) inside a Helm chart:

```json
{
    "REDIS_PORT": 6379
}
```

[`config.yaml`](./helm/python-app/templates/config.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: redis-config
data:
  config.json: |- {{ .Files.Get "files/config.json" | nindent 4 }}
```

[`deployment.yaml`](./helm/python-app/templates/deployment.yaml):

```diff
+    volumes:
+      - name: redis-config
+        configMap:
+          name: redis-config
      containers:
        - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
+          volumeMounts:
+          - name: redis-config
+            mountPath: "/config"
+            readOnly: true
```

Test:

```sh
kubectl exec $(kubectl get po -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=py-app"
-o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") -- cat /config/config.json
```

```sh
{
    "REDIS_PORT": 6379
}
```

## App upgrade

I already have a request counter that uses `redis`.

It is visible on the `/status` route:

The fact that the counter persists can be confirmed by recreating the pod:

```sh
kubectl scale deployment py-app-python-app --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment py-app-python-app --replicas=1
```

At the screenshot below, *Connection refused* appeared when the port forwarding died. After setting it up, the counter persisted:

## Bonus tasks

### Second app upgrade

Similarly to the python app, TypeScript app already does persist the request count:

### Theory task

- **StatefulSet** — an object that manages pods, assigning a unique id to them. Allows to perform ordered deployment, scaling, and updates.
- **Headless service** — Services without `ClusterIP` or load balancing. DNS lookup on their name gives IPs of all the Pods behind this service. This can be useful if an application interacting with a Pod needs to know its exact IP.
- **Persistent Volumes** — volumes that do not depend on the pods that use them, i.e., they will persist if the pods get deleted. These volumes can be used to save a database, for example.
